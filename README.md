## What is it ?
This Python program automates internships requests on Tesla website by automatically filling in the forms.  

## How to use it ?
Edit the **Personal Info** section in the source code (why bother to make a user-friendly app ?)  
Here are the fields you should fill:  
```
first_name = "first_name"  
last_name = "last_name"  
email = "email@domain.com"  
phone = "123456789"
linkedin_url = "linkedin_profile_url"  
resume_file_path = "/file/to/resume/resume.pdf"  

internships_urls=[
    "https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/apply/xxxxxx",
    "https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/apply/xxxxxx"]
```
> **Warning**:  
> • If your phone number is 0623456789, make sure to fill the ```phone``` field with ```"623456789"```, not ```"0623456789"```  
> • Make sure to enter a valid path for your resume. Else the app will quit unexpectedly which might be VERY frustrating  
> • There are lots of other fields in the form but I just didnt make a variable for all of them. If you want to edit them,
> just edit them in the code, it shouldn't be too hard to find :)

## What to do if it works ?
If you get your internship thanks to this, please tell Mr. Musk to send a self-driving Tesla to France to pick me up 🏎️  


### Enjoy and have fun 🎉
